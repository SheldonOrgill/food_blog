    <p>If you set foot on South African soil, don't leave before you've enjoyed a traditional al fresco braai, as much
      for the barbecued food as for the cultural experience. Follow it up with a popular melktert (custard-filled
      pastry) and if you fancy a little snifter to finish then a sweet and creamy glass of Amarula (liqueur) will
      definitely do the trick. </p>

        <p class="food_info">Chakalaka and pap are mainstays on every South African dinner table. Chakalaka is a
          vegetable dish made of onions, tomatoes, peppers, carrots, beans and spices, and is often served cold. Pap,
          meaning 'porridge', is similar to American grits and is a starchy dish made from white corn maize. Chakalaka
          and pap are often served together, along with braaied (barbecued) meat, breads, salad and stews.</p>

        <p class="food_info">This street food of Durban has become popular across South Africa and is now starting to
          hit our food markets back in London. Hollowed out loaves of bread, stuffed with spicy curry were originally
          created by the immigrant Indian community in the Natal area of Durban and served to workers for lunch. Try
          chicken, pork or vegetarian varieties containing lentils and beans.</p>

        <p class="food_info">For a real taste of South Africa an authentic braai or shisa nyama ('burn the meat' in
          Zulu) is an eating experience not to be missed. Braais originated in the townships of Johannesburg, with
          butchers who set up barbecues in front of their shops at weekends to grill their meat and sell it on the
          street. Nowadays, local communities gather at braais at the weekends to share food. Pop along to soak up the
          vibrant atmosphere, listen to music and take your pick from the meat on offer, usually comprising of beef,
          chicken, pork, lamb and vors (sausages) â€“ this is not an outing for vegetarians!</p>
