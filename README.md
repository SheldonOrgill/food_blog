Foods you must try in South Africa

the database (db.json) does not load because it uses a local host link so in order for the full blog to run properly it requires you to download the project and follow the following steps.

## STEPS:

 -- download the repo's contents and unzip it on the desktop

 -- install npm and node.

 -- in the console type "npm install" to install all the required files.

 -- run the node server on localhost:3000 by typing "nodemon start".

 -- run the data base on localhost:8080 by typing "json-server --watch db.json --port 8080"
